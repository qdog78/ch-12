##Issues
This was the second most challenging challenge that I have received. I had to do alot of research outside of the class for this assignment, I used google, npm.js, w3 schools, and YouTube to help me with this assignemnt while also watching class videos. 
I never had to create so many files to complete an assignemnt.

##Notes:

I did not make many commits as I leave alot of the files on my computer. I did just read one of my assignment grades and discovered commits can hurt the grade.
